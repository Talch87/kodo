Proactive Cross-Platform Review — Architect Findings
====================================================

1. Matrix coverage: Run tests on ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest × Python 3.10, 3.12.
   Catches path separators, line endings, and platform-specific behavior early.

2. Python versions: 3.10 and 3.12 cover the declared supported range (>=3.10) and the latest stable.

3. Dependencies: Use `pip install -e ".[test]"` to install the package with test extras; ensures
   pytest and project deps are available before running tests.

4. fail-fast: false — lets all matrix jobs complete so failures on one OS/Python combo don't hide others.
