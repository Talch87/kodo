Proactive Cross-Platform Review — Architect Findings
====================================================

1. Matrix coverage: Run tests on ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest × Python 3.10, 3.12.
   Catches path separators, line endings, and platform-specific behavior early.

2. Python versions: 3.10 and 3.12 cover the declared supported range (>=3.10) and the latest stable.

3. Dependencies: Use `pip install -e ".[test]"` to install the package with test extras; ensures
   pytest and project deps are available before running tests.

4. fail-fast: false — lets all matrix jobs complete so failures on one OS/Python combo don't hide others.

===================================
Run: https://github.com/ikamensh/kodo/actions/runs/22198081835
Triggered: push (ci: cross-platform test matrix)

JOBS
  ✓ test (macos-latest, 3.12) — 43s
  ✓ test (ubuntu-latest, 3.12) — 1m3s
  ✗ test (windows-latest, 3.10) — pytest exit 1
  ✗ test (windows-latest, 3.12) — pytest exit 1
  ✗ test (ubuntu-latest, 3.10) — pytest exit 1
  ✗ test (macos-latest, 3.10) — pytest exit 1

Result: 2 passed, 4 failed. Python 3.12 on ubuntu/macos passed; Python 3.10 and Windows need investigation.
