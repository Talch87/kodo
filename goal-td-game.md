# Goal: Build a Tower Defense Game

Create a browser-based tower defense game using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (single `index.html` file).

## Requirements
- Canvas-based rendering
- Grid map with a path that enemies follow
- At least 2 tower types with different stats (damage, range, fire rate)
- Enemies spawn in waves with increasing difficulty
- Player can place towers by clicking on grid cells
- Towers auto-target and shoot nearest enemy in range
- Health bar on enemies, lives counter for player
- Start wave button and money system (earn money per kill, spend to place towers)
- Simple but playable — not just a skeleton
